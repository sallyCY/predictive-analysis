# predictive-analysis

Time series and forecast analysis on weather data of different frequencies.  



Below are some highlights of the techniques used:

### Project 1

> **Data Exploration**
>
> * Moving Average
>
> **Modelling**
>
> * Time series decomposition
> * Linear regression for time series data





### Project 2

>  **Data Cleaning**
>
>  * Linear imputation (non-periodic time series data)
>  * Training and test datasets split
>
>  **Modelling**
>
>  * Time series decomposition
>  * Fourier transformation
>  * Linear regression for time series data
>  * Dynamic regression with different ARIMA error
>  * Lag predictors
